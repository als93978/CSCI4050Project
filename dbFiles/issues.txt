Issues with BookBayDB.sql
(Mainly so Austin's brainlet doesn't forget)
============================================

1. Every Promotion should have an associated User
   - (Meaning that the the line from Promotion to User
   ends in 1..*)
   - BUT, this would mean UserID in ManagePromotions must be
   not null.
   - So, even if there are no promotions in the database (b/c
   there were never any promotions created), the UserID would
   still need to be filled, which is weird and would waste space.
   - Basically, I'm not sure how mandatory enforcement works
   with association classes/join tables.
   - It's the same in the other direction (from User to Promotion)
   (Aka from Promotion to ManagePromotions)
   - For now, I'm just having it all be non-mandatory on the ERD.
